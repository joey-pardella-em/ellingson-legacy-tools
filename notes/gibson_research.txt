THE GIBSON
==========

from what i can tell:
- main ellingson mainframe
- controls tanker fleet ballast systems
- heavily protected (obviously)
- runs some custom OS
- port 7734 is interesting
- auth requires "protocol 7" whatever that is

plague definitely had access
how did he get in?
must be an insider thing

da vinci virus was loaded through gibson
modified ballast configs for oil tankers
would have caused capsizing if not caught

need to find protocol 7 documentation
