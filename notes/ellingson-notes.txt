ellingson recon notes
=====================

found their dev server through cert transparency logs
dev.ellingson-mineral.co - nginx, php backend

backup directory was wide open lol
/backup/config.bak - had some encoded creds
/backup/notes.txt - mentioned some internal github stuff

their dns has some interesting txt records too
might be worth looking at later

admin portal at admin.ellingson-mineral.co
haven't cracked it yet but working on it

need to find more about their internal network
gibson is supposedly the main target
